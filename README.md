## Summary
Some of the drawbacks to this webpage is that the value that is input into the input box must be exactly what is shown in the table. This means that no results will be show if the value in the input includes a typo or a date that is outside the date range in the table.

Recommendations to improve the webpage are:
-	To scrape data from outside sources so that the user can obtain up-to-date information on UFO sightings.
-	Allow the user to obtain partial matches in case the input box contains any typos.
